    <p>I have always been the one to fix small problems with phones/ computers at home ever since I was young. Perhaps it was because I was the oldest in a first generation Asian household. But this isn’t what brought me into college to study computers. I was actually quite clueless in my last year of secondary school on what I wanted to study. I’ve always wanted to do something that helps others so that automatically gave me the idea of studying something in the medical area. But that was unrealistic because I can’t stand the sight of needles. Jobs to help others was very broad too since that includes almost every job out there. I did feel a bit of stress thinking about it back then because I didn’t have any passions I wanted to pursue further in or even study in at college. 
<br><br> 
        It wasn’t until I started researching all the courses in the colleges nearby where computer science courses struck out to me the most. I found that I knew almost nothing about computers and since none of it was taught in secondary school I wanted to learn more about it to see if I would enjoy it. I wanted to try something completely new. It didn’t seem like a bad choice then and it seemed like a good skill to have. 
        <br>    <br>     
        I wasn’t wrong. After going through 3 years of my course now, I can say that I don’t regret picking this course. I’ve learned so much and loved most of it, especially the internship I completed in the second semester of third year.
